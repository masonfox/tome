## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)

```
Phase 1 (Setup) 
  ↓
Phase 2 (Foundational)
  ↓
Phase 3 (US1: Manual Books) 
  ↓
Phase 4 (US2: Sync Isolation)
  ↓
Phase 5 (US3: Source Filtering) ← Can start after Phase 3
  ↓
Phase 6 (US5: Migration) ← Requires Phase 7 providers
  ↓
Phase 7 (US4: Federated Search) ← Can start after Phase 2
  ↓
Phase 8 (Polish)
```

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| US1 (Manual Books) | Phase 2 | Needs repositories and services |
| US2 (Sync Isolation) | US1 | Needs manual books to test isolation |
| US3 (Source Filtering) | US1 | Needs multiple sources to filter |
| US4 (Federated Search) | Phase 2 | Independent - only needs provider infrastructure |
| US5 (Migration) | US1, US4 | Needs manual books + external providers |

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Tasks T009-T012 (repositories) can run in parallel
- Tasks T013-T015 (services) can run in parallel
- Tasks T016-T020 (provider stubs) can run in parallel

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
- Tasks T021-T022 (backend creation) parallel
- Tasks T025-T027 (validation) parallel to T021-T022
- Tasks T028-T032 (frontend forms) parallel after T021 complete
- Tasks T033-T035 (frontend badges) parallel to T028-T032

**Within Phase 7 (US4)**:
- Tasks T068-T072 (search service) parallel
- Tasks T073-T076 (provider implementations) parallel to T068-T072
- Tasks T077-T079 (provider config) parallel to T073-T076
- Tasks T080-T083 (frontend) parallel after T076 complete

## MVP Definition (Minimum Viable Product)

**Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4

**Delivers**:
- ✅ Manual book addition with validation
- ✅ Duplicate warnings (but allow proceed)
- ✅ Source badges in UI
- ✅ Calibre sync isolation (data integrity)
- ✅ All existing Tome features work for manual books

**Out of MVP**:
- ❌ Source filtering (P2)
- ❌ Source migration (P2)
- ❌ Federated search (P3)
- ❌ External providers (Hardcover, OpenLibrary)

**MVP Testing**: After Phase 4, user can:
1. Add manual book via UI
2. Log progress for manual book
3. Run Calibre sync
4. Verify manual book untouched by sync
5. View manual books alongside Calibre books with clear source indicators

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Delivery

1. **Complete Phase 1** (Setup): Database ready for multi-source
2. **Complete Phase 2** (Foundational): Services and repositories ready
3. **Ship MVP** (Phase 3 + Phase 4): Manual books + sync isolation
4. **Iterate** (Phase 5-8): Add advanced features incrementally

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Repositories, services, providers (use `setDatabase()` pattern)
- **Integration tests**: Multi-source scenarios, sync isolation, migration
- **Manual testing**: UI flows for each user story
- **Performance tests**: Source filtering (<3s), federated search (<6s)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Migration risk**: Companion migration validates data before schema change
- **Sync isolation**: Extensive testing with mixed-source libraries
- **Provider failures**: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- **Data loss**: Source migration uses transactions + pessimistic locking
