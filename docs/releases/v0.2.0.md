# Tome v0.2.0 - Navigation & Editing Enhancements

**Release Date:** December 9, 2025

This release makes Tome feel more like a native mobile app with iOS-style navigation, lets you fix incorrect page counts, and includes important bug fixes to make your reading tracking more accurate.

## ✨ What's New

### 📱 iOS-Style Bottom Navigation

Make Tome feel like a native iPhone app! You can now switch to bottom navigation that's perfect for one-handed use.

**What you get:**
- **One-handed navigation**: Easy thumb access to all major features
- **Four quick tabs**: Jump between Dashboard, Library, Stats, and More
- **Your choice**: Switch between top or bottom navigation anytime in Settings
- **Remembers your preference**: Set it once and forget it
- **Works great as a home screen app**: Add Tome to your iPhone home screen for the full native experience

**How to enable it:**
1. Open Settings
2. Toggle "Use Bottom Navigation"
3. That's it!

### ✏️ Edit Book Page Counts

Made a mistake entering page counts? Got a different edition? Now you can fix it!

**What happens when you edit:**
- Click "Edit" next to any book's page count
- Enter the correct number of pages
- Your current reading progress updates automatically
- Your reading history stays accurate

**Example:** If you're 150 pages into a book you thought was 300 pages, but it's actually 400 pages, your progress percentage will automatically adjust from 50% to 37.5%.

### 🆕 Try New Features Early

Want to test upcoming features before they're officially released?

**Nightly builds** are now available! These are automatically built every night from the latest development code. Great for trying new features early, but use stable releases for your main library.

**How to use:**
```bash
# Try the latest experimental features
docker pull ghcr.io/masonfox/tome:nightly
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

### 📊 Streak Chart Accuracy

Your streak chart now shows the correct dates and respects your timezone!

**What's fixed:**
- No more future dates appearing on your streak chart
- Dates now match your local timezone instead of showing UTC times
- "Today" is calculated based on where you actually are

### 🔍 Library Search Made Clearer

Searching your library is now more predictable.

**What changed:**
- Added a Search button - click it or press Enter to search
- No more automatic filtering while you're still typing
- Clearer when a search is active vs. just typing

### 🎨 Visual Polish

Small tweaks that make a big difference:

- **Light mode streak chart**: Goal line is now clearly visible (no more squinting!)
- **Backup cleanup**: Old backup folders are properly removed, keeping things tidy
- **Rounded buttons**: Calibre sync button matches the rest of the UI
- **Navigation highlights**: Fixed incorrect button highlighting in the More menu

### ⚡ Performance

The app should feel a bit snappier:

- Bottom navigation switches faster between tabs
- Library search is more responsive
- Reduced unnecessary background processing
