# Tome v0.4.0 - Tag Management & Auto-Completion

**Release Date:** January 5, 2026

This release brings comprehensive tag management with bi-directional Calibre sync, automatic book completion, and significant performance improvements throughout the app.

## ✨ What's New

### 🏷️ Tag Management

Finally! A dedicated page to manage all your book tags in one place.

**What you can do:**
- **Browse all tags** with book counts at `/tags`
- **Rename tags** with conflict detection
- **Merge similar tags** (e.g., combine "Sci-Fi" and "Science Fiction")
- **Delete multiple tags** at once
- **View books by tag** with a single click
- **Automatic Calibre sync** - changes sync back to your Calibre library

All tag changes sync to your Calibre library automatically, so your metadata stays consistent everywhere.

### ✅ Progress Log Completion & Read Transition Improvements

Books now automatically transition to the "Read" status when you submit a progress log at 100%. From there, it will prompt a modal with rating and review.

Additionally, transitions from "Want To Read" and "Read Next" statuses to "Read" are _significantly_ more streamlined: you're presented with a **single modal** that allows you to set pages, start/end date, rating, and review. This makes backfilling historical reads significantly less frictional! 🚤

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

The app is now significantly faster and more responsive:

- **Instant UI updates** - see changes immediately
- **Smart caching** - pages load faster with less data fetching
- **Scroll position memory** - return to where you were in the library
- **Skeleton loading** - see page layouts while content loads
- **Optimized images** - book covers load progressively

### 📱 Better Mobile Experience

- **Scroll-to-top button** on long pages
- **Improved bottom navigation** with better spacing and touch targets
- **Full-height modals** for better mobile viewing, such as the Dashboard progress log.

### 📊 Enhanced Logging

For self-hosters, logging is now more comprehensive:

- Logs to both console and files when configured with `LOG_DEST`
- Request tracking with correlation IDs
- Configurable log levels via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable

## 🐛 Notable Bug Fixes

- Fixed tag operations not persisting correctly
- Fixed library not refreshing after finishing books from dashboard
- Fixed reading history display for single-session books
- Fixed markdown editor cursor positioning issues
- Fixed timezone handling in streak calculations
